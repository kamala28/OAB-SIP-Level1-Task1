Landing Page
The Baba Smart Genius Abacus and Chess Academy landing page, meticulously crafted during my internship at Oasis Infobyte, serves as a gateway to the academy’s offerings. This standalone web page captures the essence of both disciplines—abacus and chess—while enticing visitors to explore further. By leveraging HTML and CSS, I’ve designed a clean, distraction-free layout that emphasizes the academy’s unique features and benefits.
